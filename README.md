# national-voter-servcie-portal-clone
I have tried to make a frontend clone of the national voter servcice portal website(NVSP)
The frontend clone have been made using the HTML form elements.

Working: The user will be able to fill in the first name,surname,age,gender etc whcih have been done using the html user-input elements
,radio buttons,dropdowns,date and time inputs and others and the form also contains the basic form validation so if user doesn't fill in the required data and press on the button on the fill then it shows "please fill in the required field"

STACK USED: HTML | CSS
